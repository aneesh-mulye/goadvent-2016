## Notes on specific days

### Day 1

Kinda surprised that there isn't a function in the standard library to read a
text by line into a slice of strings, with the newlines stripped out.

The lower level machinery is good; still, slightly surprising.

TODO: any existing utility libraries that provide all these things one
sorta-kinda expects from a language flirting with dynamism, implied by âˆƒGC?

### Day 2

Complex numbers turning out surprisingly useful here.

As a friend said, a language with a *proper* numeric stack has not yet been
made.

### Day 3

TIL that Go has accreted *two* sets of functions for sorting (and almost
certainly other things as well): one from the Before \[T\]imes, when you didn't
have generics and had to have different sort functions for each type, such as
`sort.Ints`, and another from after generics, from the `slices` package, which
contains a generic `slices.Sort` that operates on any ordered type.

I'm increasingly tempted to use `https://github.com/samber/lo`, or something
like it, for solving these problems. It's just so much more congenial to think
of them in terms of the functional sequence transforms rather than basically
building up a variant of that machinery every single time for every problem
using manual loops and whatnot.

Given that I want to learn it, may just do that once I've solved enough problems
that I'm confident in my ability to work idiomatically within the language.
